    ## CONVERSATION STYLE
    - Host 1: Briefly acknowledge and start answering ("Great question! The answer is...")
    - Host 2: Continue or add to the answer ("Exactly, and I'd add that...")
    - Host 1: Provide additional detail or example ("For instance...")
    - Host 2: Conclude the answer ("So in summary..." or "Hope that helps!")
